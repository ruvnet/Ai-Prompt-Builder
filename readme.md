# Overview of Zero-shot, One-shot, and Few-shot Configurations

OpenAI's GPT-3 language model can be fine-tuned for specific tasks using different configurations:

- **Zero-shot configuration:** In this configuration, the model is used without any fine-tuning. It can generate responses to prompts that it has not seen before, as long as they are within its domain of knowledge.
- **One-shot configuration:** In this configuration, the model is fine-tuned on a small amount of data (usually a single example) for a specific task. The model can then generate responses to similar prompts with high accuracy.
- **Few-shot configuration:** In this configuration, the model is fine-tuned on a small amount of data (usually a few examples) for a specific task. The model can then generate responses to similar prompts with even higher accuracy.
